# TODO for Binary Tree and BST Implementation

- [x] Create java/BinaryTree.java with Node class, traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), views (top, bottom, left, right), utilities (height, size), and sample driver in main.
- [x] Create java/BinarySearchTree.java with Node class, insert, delete, search methods, traversals, and sample driver in main.
- [x] Compile both Java files to check for errors.
- [x] Run the sample drivers to verify output.
- [x] Commit the new files to the blackboxai/dijkstra-algorithm branch (or new branch if needed).
- [x] Push the changes to GitHub.
- [ ] Create a pull request using GitHub CLI (requires user to run `gh auth login` first).
